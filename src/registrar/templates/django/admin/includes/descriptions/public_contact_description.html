<p>
Public contacts represent the three registry contact types (administrative, technical, and security) 
and their fields that are exposed in WHOIS data. 
</p>

<p>
We donâ€™t currently allow registrants to publish real contact information to WHOIS, 
but we must publish something to WHOIS. For each of the contact types, we use default values that are 
associated with the program instead of the real contact information, 
which we then redact in whole at the registry/WHOIS. 
We do allow registrants to set a security contact email address, 
which is published to WHOIS when a user sets one.

<p>
The public contacts in this table are a reflection of the data in the registry and should not be updated. 
This information is primarily used by developers for validation purposes.
