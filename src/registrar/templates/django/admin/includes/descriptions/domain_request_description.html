<p>
This table contains all domain requests that have been started within the registrar and the status of those requests. 
Updating values here will immediately update the corresponding values that users see in the registrar. 
</p>

<p>
Once a domain request has been adjudicated, the details of that request should not be modified. 
To update attributes (like an organization’s name) after a domain’s approval, 
go to <a class="text-underline" href="{% url 'admin:registrar_domain_changelist' %}">Domains</a>. 
Similar fields display on each Domain page, but edits made there will not affect the corresponding domain request.
