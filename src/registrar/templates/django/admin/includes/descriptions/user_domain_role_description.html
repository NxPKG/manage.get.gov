This table represents the managers who are assigned to each domain in the registrar. 
There are separate records for each domain/manager combination. 
Managers can update information related to a domain, such as DNS data and security contact.

<p>
The creator of an approved domain request automatically becomes a manager for that domain. 
Anyone who retrieves a domain invitation is also assigned the manager role.
