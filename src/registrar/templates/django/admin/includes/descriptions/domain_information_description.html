<p>
Domain information represents the basic metadata for an approved domain and the organization that manages it. 
It does not include any information specific to the registry (DNS name servers, security email). 
Registry-related information 
can be managed within the <a class="text-underline" href="{% url 'admin:registrar_domain_changelist' %}">Domains</a> table.
</p>

<p>
Updating values here will immediately update the corresponding values that users see in the registrar.
</p>

<p>
Domain information is similar to <a class="text-underline" href="{% url 'admin:registrar_domainrequest_changelist' %}">Domain requests</a>, 
and the fields are nearly identical, 
but edits made to one are not made to the other. 
Domain information exists so we donâ€™t modify details of an approved request after adjudication 
(since a domain request should be maintained as-adjudicated for records retention purposes). 
Entries are created here upon approval of a domain request.
