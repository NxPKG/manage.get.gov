Contacts include anyone who has access to the registrar (known as “users”) and anyone listed in a domain request, 
including other employees and senior officials. 
Only contacts who have access to the registrar will have 
a corresponding record within the <a class="text-underline" href="{% url 'admin:registrar_user_changelist' %}">Users</a> table.
</p>

<p>
Updating someone’s contact information here will not affect that person’s Login.gov information.
