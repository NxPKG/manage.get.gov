<p>
This table contains users who have been allowed to bypass identity proofing through Login.gov after approval by a CISA representative. 
Bypassing identity proofing means they will not be asked to provide a form of ID, PII, and so on. 
</p>

<p>
Additions to this table should be rare, and only after obtaining confirmation of their identity directly (or from a trusted person). 
Once a verified-by-staff user has been added as a domain manager, they can be removed from this list, 
(However, if they are removed as a domain manager for all domains and they attempt to sign in again, they will be identity proofed by Login.gov).
