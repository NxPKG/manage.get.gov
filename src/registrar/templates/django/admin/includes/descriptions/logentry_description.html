<p>
Log entries represent instances where something was created, updated, or deleted within the registrar or /admin. 
The table on this page is useful for searching actions across all records. 
To understand what happened to an individual record (like a domain request), 
it’s better to go to that specific page 
(<a class="text-underline" href="{% url 'admin:registrar_domainrequest_changelist' %}">Domain requests</a>) and click on the “History” button.
