<p>
This table represents all “requested domains” that have been saved within a domain request form. 
If a registrant changes the requested domain in their form, 
the original name they listed and the new name will appear as separate records.
</p>

<p>
This table does not include “alternative domains,” 
which are housed in the <a class="text-underline" href="{% url 'admin:registrar_website_changelist' %}">Websites</a> table.
