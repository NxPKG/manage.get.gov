<p>
This table contains all approved domains in the .gov registrar. 
In other words, with the exception of domains in the “Unknown”, ”On hold”, and “Deleted” states, 
this table matches the list of domains in the .gov zone file. 
</p>

<p>
Individual domain pages allow you to view registry-related details and edit the associated domain information. 
</p>

<p>
Other actions available on the domain page include the ability to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Extend a domain’s expiration date</li>
    <li>Place a domain “On hold”</li> 
    <li>Remove a domain from the registry</li>
    <li>View the domain from a domain manager’s perspective 
</ul>

<p>
To view a domain from a domain manager’s perspective, click the "Manage domain" button. 
That will allow you to make changes (e.g., update DNS settings, invite people to manage the domain) 
directly inside the registrar.
